**Q1: Explain the difference between goroutines and OS threads. What's the Go scheduler (G-M-P model)?**

**Answer:**
- Goroutines are lightweight (2KB stack), managed by Go runtime; OS threads are managed by the OS (1-8MB).
- G-M-P: G (goroutines), M (OS threads), P (logical processors). P maps to M; Gs are executed by M via P.
- Benefits: faster creation, lower memory, better context switching, user-space scheduling.

**Q2: How does context.Context work? When should you use it?**
**Answer:**
- Manages cancellation, deadlines, timeouts, and request-scoped values.
- Use for: cancellation propagation, timeouts, request tracing.
- Rules: pass as first parameter, don't store in structs, derive via `context.WithCancel/Timeout/Deadline`.

**Q3: What's a goroutine leak? How do you prevent it?**
**Answer:**
- Leak occurs when a goroutine never terminates.
- Prevention: use contexts for cancellation, close channels, use timeouts, monitor with `runtime.NumGoroutine()`.

**Q4: Explain channel directions and channel patterns (fan-in, fan-out, worker pools).**
**Answer:**
- Directional channels: send-only `chan<-`, receive-only `<-chan`, bidirectional `chan`.
- Fan-out: one channel feeds multiple workers.
- Fan-in: multiple channels feed one channel.
- Worker pool: fixed workers consume from a job channel.

**Q5: Compare sync.Mutex vs sync.RWMutex vs sync.Map vs atomic operations.**
**Answer:**
- `sync.Mutex`: exclusive lock.
- `sync.RWMutex`: many readers OR one writer.
- `sync.Map`: concurrent-safe map (optimized for few writes, many reads).
- `atomic`: lock-free primitives (faster, limited ops).

### **2. MEMORY MANAGEMENT & PERFORMANCE**

**Q6: How does Go garbage collector work? Explain GC phases.**
**Answer:**
- Tri-color mark-and-sweep, concurrent, low-latency.
- Phases: mark setup, marking (concurrent), mark termination (stop-the-world), sweep (concurrent).
- Tuned by `GOGC` (100% = GC when memory doubles), can tune via `runtime/debug`.

**Q7: What causes memory leaks in Go?**
**Answer:**
- Goroutine leaks, maps/slices growing indefinitely, caches without eviction, finalizers blocking, `runtime.SetFinalizer` misuse.

**Q8: How do you profile Go applications?**
**Answer:**
- `go tool pprof` (CPU, memory), `go tool trace`, `runtime/pprof`.
- Methods: HTTP endpoints, benchmarks, production sampling.
- Common: CPU hotspots, allocations, goroutine leaks.

**Q9: Explain escape analysis and stack vs heap allocation.**
**Answer:**
- Escape analysis determines if a value escapes the stack.
- Stack: fast, function-local, limited size.
- Heap: slower, shared, GC-managed.
- Use `go build -gcflags=-m` to inspect escapes.

**Q10: How do you optimize Go code performance?**
**Answer:**
- Profile first, reduce allocations, use object pools (`sync.Pool`), reuse buffers, avoid unnecessary copies, use appropriate data structures, leverage compiler optimizations.

### **3. INTERFACES & TYPE SYSTEM**

**Q11: Explain Go interfaces and implicit satisfaction.**
**Answer:**
- Interface = set of methods; types implement implicitly.
- Benefits: decoupling, testability, polymorphism.
- Use small interfaces (`io.Reader`, `io.Writer`).

**Q12: What's the empty interface? When should you avoid it?**
**Answer:**
- `interface{}` (or `any`) accepts any type.
- Avoid when type safety is needed; prefer generics (Go 1.18+) or concrete types.

**Q13: Explain type assertions vs type switches.**
**Answer:**
- Assertion: `val, ok := i.(Type)`, `val := i.(Type)` (panics if fails).
- Type switch: `switch v := i.(type) { case int: ... }`.
- Use assertions for single checks, switches for multiple.

**Q14: What are generics? How do you use them?**
**Answer:**
- Type parameters (Go 1.18+).
- Example:
```go
func Min[T comparable](a, b T) T {
    if a < b { return a }
    return b
}
```
- Constraints: `comparable`, `any`, or custom interfaces.

**Q15: Explain type embedding vs composition.**
**Answer:**
- Embedding: inner struct methods promoted to outer.
- Composition: explicit delegation.
- Embedding for "is-a", composition for "has-a".

### **4. ERROR HANDLING**

**Q16: How do you handle errors in Go? Best practices?**
**Answer:**

- Avoid panics except unrecoverable cases.

**Q17: Explain error wrapping with errors.Is() and errors.As().**
**Answer:**
- `errors.Is(err, target)`: checks if error chain contains target.
- `errors.As(err, &target)`: finds first assignable error in chain.
- Use with `%w` for wrapping.

**Q18: When should you panic vs return an error?**
**Answer:**
- Panic: programmer errors, unrecoverable states.
- Error: expected failures (network, I/O, validation).
